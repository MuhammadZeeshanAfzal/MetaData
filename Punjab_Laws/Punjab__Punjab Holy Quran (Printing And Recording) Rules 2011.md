    STANDARD GUIDE FOR SELECTION OF PERMANENT
    AND DURABLE OFFSET BOOK PAPERS
    Offset Book Paper both side coated or uncoated may be used for the printing of the Holy Quran as a permanent record. Permanent records usually are expected to last several hundred years in a record repository, with little change in properties that affect readability or handling, although some records are expected to have shorter lifetime.
1.  Fiber composition
    Offset Paper used for the Holy Quran should be made from cotton, line or fully bleached wood free fiber.
1.  Re-cycled paper
    Offset paper used for printing the Holy Quran should be free from re-cycled fiber.
