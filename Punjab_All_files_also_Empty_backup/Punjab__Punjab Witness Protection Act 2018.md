    (a) that an order is necessary:
    (i) to ensure the safety of the witness or any other person, or to prevent any serious damage to property; or
    (ii) to prevent real and significant harm to the public interest;
    (b) that the effect of the order, in no circumstances, would prevent the accused from receiving a fair trial; and

    (i) there is a genuine risk that witness would not testify if the order were not made; or
    (ii) there would be a genuine risk of real and significant harm to the public interest if the witness were to testify without such an order being made.
    (4) While considering whether the conditions in subsection (3) have been met, the court shall take into consideration all of the relevant circumstances, and in particular:
    (a) the general right of the accused to know the identity of the witness;

    (c) whether the evidence could be properly tested without the witness's identity being disclosed; and
    (d) whether the witness has a tendency or any motive to be dishonest.
    (5) An order made under this section shall be known as a `Witness Anonymity Order' and shall remain in force during the period specified in the order unless the order is sooner revoked or any other order is made.
