(b) On completion of proceedings, the employee may be awarded minor or major penalties under the section 4 of the PEEDA Act 2006. However, the following factors may be kept in mind while imposing any penalty:
(i) penalty should be commensurate with the gravity of charges;
(ii) punishments to contract employees will be specific such as censure, stoppage of increments, fine, recovery, removal and dismissal from service;
(iii) one increment is earned in a calendar year, therefore, punishment of withholding one increment may be awarded for a period of one year;
(iv) in case more than one increments are to be withheld then the same should correspond to the number of years. For example penalty of withholding of five increments may be awarded as under:
withholding of annual increments for a period of five years. ;

(v) Detail of charges or allegations
In previous disciplinary law or rules, charge sheet was prepared separately while in the PEEDA Act 2006, the detail of charges has to be reflected in the order of enquiry, issued by the competent authority. However, charges should be specific and give all necessary details. Sometimes it happens that complete charges are not reflected in the original enquiry order, hence, the cases are remanded to reframe the charges which create administrative as well as legal complications. Therefore, in the original enquiry order, complete charges should be included apportioning the responsibility in case of joint enquiry.
(vi) Suspension
(a) Section 6 of the PEEDA Act, 2006 provides that the competent authority may place the employees under suspension for a period of 90 days if an action is proposed to be initiated against him and suspension is considered necessary.

(b) Clauses (a) and (b) of subsection (1) of section 5 read with section 7 of the PEEDA Act 2006, give detailed grounds and procedure for summary proceedings against an accused. However, proviso to Clause (b) of subsection (1) section 5 makes it mandatory upon the competent authority to dispense with the enquiry in following cases:
(i) an employee has been convicted of any offence other than corruption by a court of law under any law for the time being in force; or
(ii) an employee is or has been absent from duty without prior approval of leave:
Provided that the competent authority may dispense with the inquiry where it is in possession of sufficient documentary evidence against the accused or, for reasons to be recorded in writing, he is satisfied that there is no need to hold an inquiry.

(d) In case, an employee is acquitted from the court of law as a result of compounding of an offence then procedure provided in section 9 of the PEEDA Act, 2006 may be adopted i.e. a regular inquiry may be held against the accused to substantiate the charges.
(ix) Appointment of inquiry officer
Under clause (a) of subsection (1) of section 9 of the PEEDA Act 2006 an inquiry officer shall be senior in rank to the accused. Rank means official position or standing and not the basic scale.
