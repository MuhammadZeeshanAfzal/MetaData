    SYMPTOMS OF POISONING, FIRST-AID
    AND ANTIDOTES
    Chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticide Symptoms,-these insecticide affect the central nervous system leading to convulsions, exhaustion, Numbers of extremities, apprehensions and excitement are other symptoms of poisoning from these insecticides.
    First-Aid-As absorption through skin is most likely route of poisoning it is essential to wash off the contaminant from the body with soap and water and remove the soiled clothing. In case of ingestion evacuation of stomach is necessary.
    Antidotes,- Usual antidotes are paraldehyde or a water-soluble barbiturate given intramuscularly or thiopentone or diazepam administered intravenously. Organophosphates and carbamate insecticides
    Symptoms,- These compounds depress cholinesterase enzyme activity in the body tissue, blood and brain. Usual symptoms of intoxication the muscular trembling, weakness, colds wear, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, irritability or restlessness coupled with constricted pupil/pupils and a feeling of tightness in chest.
    First-Aid,- Necessary steps may be taken immediately to decontaminate the patient. If exposure is mild the effect will be transient. In severe cases death may occur. Keep the patient at rest and maintain respiration by artificial means, if necessary. Immediate steps may also be taken to hospitalize the patient. Antidotes, - If symptoms are obvious first dose of two tablets of atropine sulphate (of 0.6 mg. Strength each) may be administered by giving one tablet each at an interval of 20-30 minutes.
    Fumigants.
    Cyanides-Symptoms, - Slight poisoning causes metallic taste in the mouth, irritation of the nose and throat, dizziness, frontal headache, constriction of chest weakness of limbs and a sensation of lack of air. These symptoms appear within a few seconds or minutes of exposure and if these warnings are ignored and if immediate treatment is not made available death may follow quickly.
    First -Aid,-Remove the patient from the contaminated area. Keep at rest and remove contaminated clothing and wash skin thoroughly. Start artificial respiration.
    Antidotes, - Cobalt EDTA or sodium nitrate and sodium thiosulphate are standard antidotes. Treatment should be given by a medical practitioner. Antidotes, - Where exposure is mild recovery will take place without special treatment, in other cases BAL is recommended to be tried as antidote. Treatment should therefore be symptomatic.
    Etylene dichloride, - Symptoms- Effects are narcotic and cause renal and liver damage and the irritation of mucous membranes.
    Antidote, - No specific antidotes are available. Therefore treatment should be symptomatic.
    Ethylene dibromide- Symptoms- Blistering occurs on coma with skin causes irritation of mucous membrane.
    First-Aid- Splashes should be washed from the skin and contaminated clothing removed.
    Antidote,-Symptomatic treatment may be provided because of absence of any specific antidotes.
    Phosphene- Symptoms- Effect gastrointestinal tract and central nervous systems with nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea.
    Antidote, - No specific antidotes are available which calls for symptomatic treatment.
