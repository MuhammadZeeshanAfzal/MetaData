        "Short Summary of the Case": "This judgment by the Federal Shariat Court of Pakistan concerns the re-determination of numerous Shariat Petitions challenging the prevalence of Riba (interest) in the Pakistani financial system. The case was remanded by the Supreme Court's Shariat Appellate Bench in 2002 after setting aside previous judgments by both the Federal Shariat Court (1991) and the Supreme Court (1999) on the issue. The Court addresses various arguments raised by parties regarding the definition and prohibition of Riba, including whether it applies to commercial loans or only usurious rates. It reaffirms the absolute prohibition of Riba in all its forms, citing extensive Islamic jurisprudence and the consensus of scholars. The judgment notes the significant development and practicality of Islamic banking in the two decades since the remand, which has rendered many previous objections irrelevant. The Court emphasizes the need to eliminate Riba from the economy in accordance with Islamic injunctions.",

        "Short Summary of the Case": "The petitioner, M/s Najaat Welfare Foundation, filed a Shariat Petition seeking to declare certain paragraphs of D.F. Mulla's 'Principles of Muhammaden Law' as repugnant to the injunctions of Islam. The petitioner argued that despite not being statutory law, the book's continuous practice gives it the force of law, making it challengeable before the Federal Shariat Court. The respondents contended that the book is merely a reference and not statutory law, thus outside the court's jurisdiction. The court examined the nature and history of D.F. Mulla's book and Anglo-Muhammadan legal literature, concluding that the book is a textbook or reference and does not constitute statutory law or custom with the force of law. The court also noted the evolution of Muslim Personal Law jurisprudence by Pakistani superior courts and the availability of other resources on Islamic inheritance. Finding the petition misconceived and the prayer pointless, the court dismissed the petition, also stating it lacks jurisdiction to direct the legislature to enact laws on inheritance.",

The court framed consensus issues to determine the meaning and scope of 'Hudood' and the extent of its jurisdiction. The judgment defines 'Hudood' broadly to include Tazir punishments and ancillary matters related to Hadd offences. It holds that the constitutional jurisdiction of the Federal Shariat Court cannot be limited by ordinary legislation. Specifically, sections 11 and 28 of Act VI of 2006, which repealed overriding clauses in the Hudood Ordinances, were declared unconstitutional and repugnant to Islam. The court affirmed its exclusive appellate, revisional, and bail jurisdiction in all matters relating to the enforcement of Hudood, including Tazir cases akin to Hadd offences.

The prohibitions are deemed not to interfere with their right to practice their own religion under a different identity. The petitions were dismissed.",

The petitioners argued these provisions violate Islamic law. The Federal Shariat Court examined the Islamic principles of marriage, divorce, and Khula, finding that while a wife seeking Khula without the husband's fault may be required to return dower, the specific fixed percentages mandated by the Act are not supported by the Quran or Sunnah and contradict the principle that the amount should be determined based on the specific circumstances of the case. The Court declared the challenged subsections un-Islamic and void from May 1, 2022.",

The challenges primarily concern land ownership ceilings, compensation for acquired land, restrictions on partition and alienation of land, and tenant rights. The court examines its jurisdiction, concluding it cannot challenge the land ceiling and compensation provisions due to constitutional protection, but can review restrictions on property rights and pre-emption laws. The document provides an extensive analysis of Islamic principles on property, wealth, state intervention, and tenancy, citing religious texts and juristic views, but the provided text concludes before the final decision on the provisions within the court's jurisdiction.",
