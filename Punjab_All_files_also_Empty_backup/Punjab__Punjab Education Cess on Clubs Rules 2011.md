(2) In case no return is filed under sub-rule (1) or if in the opinion of the Assessing Authority, the statement furnished by the club management is not correct or is incomplete or the Assessing Authority has reasons to believe that the amount of cess shown in the return is suppressed to evade or reduce the actual liability, the Assessing Authority shall, after giving such club management an opportunity of hearing, proceed to determine the amount of cess payable by the club. 4. Order in writing.---Every order of assessment shall be in writing and in case the Assessing Authority determines the amount of cess higher than that mentioned in the statement furnished by the club management, the order shall briefly state the reasons for such higher assessment. 5. Power to enter.---The Assessing Authority or any other officer, not below the rank of Assistant Excise and Taxation Officer authorized by the Assessing Authority in this behalf, may enter upon the premises of the club or call for any relevant record for purposes of determination of the amount of cess payable. 6.

Payment of cess after notice.---(1) Every club management shall, unless it has already paid the cess, on receipt of the notice in Form CC-4 from the Assessing Authority, file a return and pay the cess within seven days.
(2) If no return is furnished by the club management in response to notice in Form CC-4 or fails to avail itself of an opportunity of hearing, the Assessing Authority shall after making such enquires as it may deem necessary, assess the cess on the club and issue a demand notice in Form CC-5.
(3) The said demand notice shall be accompanied by a treasury challan in Form CC-6. 9. Recovery of amount due.---If any sum due on account of cess is not paid within the prescribed period, the Assessing Authority shall proceed to recover the same as arrears of land revenue. 10. Appeal.---(1) A person aggrieved by an order of the Assessing Authority may, within fifteen days of the communication of such order, prefer an appeal to the Collector.
(2) An appeal under sub-rule (1) shall be preferred by means of a memorandum and shall be accompanied by a certified copy of the order appealed against. 11. Correction of clerical mistake.---The authority making an order under these rules may correct any clerical or arithmetical error or any erroneous insertion or any incorrect description apparent on the face of the record. 12. Adjustment of the cess not due.---(1) If, on an application made in this behalf or otherwise, an Assessing Authority, after such inquiry as it may consider necessary, is satisfied that owing to a clerical or arithmetical error or for some other reasons, a cess has been wrongly assessed in respect of any club, or has been deposited or recovered in excess of the amount due, the Assessing Authority may, by order in writing giving reasons, direct the rectification of the assessment or, as the case may be, the refund of the cess deposited or recovered in excess of the cess due.
